- [x] make reusable hook in task and tasklist => no op
- [x] pass as few params in dispatch

  - [x] handle text overflow
  - [x] coloring
  - [x] minimal transitions
- [x] bug: shift + enter on 'get back to tasklist' button

Backlog:
  - [ ] make the items be flex-items, and the bottom arrow to fill the empty space
  - [ ] make splash screen
  - [ ] make title horizontally scrollable by arrow keys
  - [ ] checkbox moves a little to the left when title is long string without whitespace
  - [ ] use monospace font for titles, insert your font
  - [ ] show the user when delete task action cannot be done because of ongoing request
